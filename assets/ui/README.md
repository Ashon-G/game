# UI Assets

Place your UI sprite files here:

## Required Files
- `speech-bubble.png` - 8-bit pixel speech bubble sprite

## Asset Sources
- Speech Bubble: https://pngtree.com/freepng/8-bit-pixel-speech-bubble_4602322.html
- Alternative: https://opengameart.org/content/speech-bubbles

## Current Implementation
The app currently uses styled View components to create speech bubbles. 
When you add the PNG assets, update the SpeechBubble component in battle.tsx to use Image instead.
